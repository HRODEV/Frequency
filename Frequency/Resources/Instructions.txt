START: Every player draws a climate card and starts with F500.
TURNS: Every player can make four moves within a turn. You can't rollback a move you have made.

MONEY
If your unit stands on land within your own climate, you'll receive F50 per piece per land. 
However, if the unit is on a piece of land of your opponent, you'll receive F100. 
If your unit is on the goldmine, you'll receive F150.

CAPTURING
When you want to capture the land you have to leave troops with at least the value of 1. 
Control land to keep gaining frequency.
If you want to take over land of an opponent, you have to fight for it.
The fighter with the highest attack value wins.
Example: Tank(3/3) vs Soldier (1/2) = Tank wins and becomes (3/2)
You can not attack when you are on a boat.
HOW TO WIN: Be the first player to own F50000 or take control over 2 enemy bases.
