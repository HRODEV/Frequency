		<money>
			<text>
				You receive money if you have atleast one unit on a piece of land. If the unit stands on land within your own climate, you'll receive F50 per 
				piece per land. However, if the unit is on a piece of land of your opponent, you'll receive F100.

				If your unit is on the goldmine, you'll receive F150.

		<capturing>
			<text>
				All areas, except the corners, have a standard value of 0. When you want to capture the land
you have to leave troops with at least the value of 1. It is of great importance to control land 
in order to earn frequencyâ€™s. You can also take control of land that is in possession of an 
enemy. When you want to take land that is in possession you have to fight for it. The person 
with the higher value of troops will win the fight and earn the piece of land. The value that is 
left is the sum of hitpoints/values of the soldiers. So when team A has 3 hitpoints and attacks 
team B which has 1 hitpoint, it is 3 vs 1 which results in 3-1=2, so the winner has a remaining 
value of 2. You can not attack when you are on a boat.
